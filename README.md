# Project Purpose
Parallel Computing Course **CS424** | Practical Assesment

## **TASK 1:** Parallel Sum (*Multithreading.java*)
* Starts an executer that manages a thread pool of size *THREAD_COUNT*. (Maximum threads in the CPU)         
* Runs a task to increment a global sum variable 1000 times. (Execution is assigned to an avalible thread at run-time.)
* Applies three different critical section controls to prevent race-condition.


## **TASK 2:** Parallel Factorial (*parallel_factorial.c*)
Implements parallel factorial calculation using OpenMP
